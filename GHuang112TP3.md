Klutzy Grace’s Cafe!

Welcome to Klutzy Grace’s Cafe, where you are Grace the waitress, serving drinks and deserts to bunnies. Grace is a little klutzy, and has a tendency to run all over the cafe before she finds her customer to deliver to. So, please work hard to acquire and prepare the ingredients in a timely manner - before the customer runs out of patience and leaves!! Earn as many tips as you can. Enjoy the game!!

Orders will be randomly generated from the menu, and each will have a base with two toppings. Specifically, each generated order will have 1 of four bases: cake roll, milk tea, crepe cake, and sunday ice cream. There are 6 possible toppings: matcha, chocolate, mango, strawberry, ube, and red bean. Players will prepare their orders through a drag and drop interface onto a counter. Once all ingredients are added to the counter, then the player will be taken to a new screen, where they must process the two toppings, either by grinding it (like grinding matcha powder), or cutting it. After they finish preparing both toppings, an order is completed, and the player is taken back to the original screen to click on the customer to send it to. Once selected, the waitress character will travel over to the table. When they arrive at the table, the order is done and money is earned! The customer will leave, so other customers can come in, and the waitress will travel back to the counter to wait for the next order to be prepared. The speed at which orders are completed will correlate with how much tip the server gets, which will go to the overall income of the server.
